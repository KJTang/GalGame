(unfinished)
this is a galgame which used cocos2d-x;

it includes a "ScriptController" which can read script from
some file to help to control the game;

cocos2d-x is only used to draw pictures, play music 
and the like;

so it is not only a game, but has a tool to make galgame,
when i finish my work, maybe i'll write some docs about how
to use this tool to make galgame

--WARNING--
the codes are terrible, it cannot be a good tutorial, unless
I optimize them someday; so before that day...
