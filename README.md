this is a galgame which used cocos2d-x written by c++;
and it includes a "ScriptControll" which can read script from
some file ro help to control the game;
so it is not only a game, but has a tool to make galgame,
when i finish my work, maybe i'll write some docs about how
to make galgames use this tool
